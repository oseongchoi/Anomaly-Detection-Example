# Anomaly-Detection-Example

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate several types of anomaly detection machines. <br>
The target data is from: http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/smtp-kddcup99-dataset/ <br>

### List of implementations:

 - [Statistics] Multivariate distribution estimation.
 - [Machine-Learning] Principle components analysis(PCA).
 - [Machine-Learning] One-class support vector machine(SVM).
 - [Machine-Learning] Conditional probability estimation with regressions.
 - [Deep-Learning] Auto-encoder(AE) network.
 - [Deep-Learning] Mixture model network.
